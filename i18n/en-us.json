    "watch_this_video_of_a": "Watch this video of a rescued cow from the For the Animals Sanctuary playing with his new ball.",
    "when_they_pass_away": "When they pass away, we mourn them. We no doubt also believe that they enjoy being alive as much as they enjoy the company of others. Yet, for other animals, we stick forks and knives into their bodies and wear their skin as clothing.",
    "moral_dissonance": "Moral Dissonance",
    "if_it_is_wrong_to_act": "If it is wrong to act violently to a dog or cat just for enjoyment or convenience, how can we justify the horrible things we do to other animals?",
    "we_certainly_do_not_need": "We certainly do not need to eat animal products to be healthy; we do so only because it is a habit and we enjoy the taste of these products.",
    "some_of_us_try": "Some of us try to address this inconsistency by purchasing products that are marketed as “humane” or as produced \"ethically.\" However, as you’ll see, these words are meaningless and actually do very little to give animals a better life.",
    "in_any_case_these_terms": "In any case, these terms encourage the public to believe it is okay to exploit animals simply because we enjoy it. This strange contradiction is our moral dissonance. We can overcome this social affliction and respect life by going vegan.",
    "cant_we_just_consume_humane": "Can't We Just Consume \"Humane\" Animal Products?",
    "asking_how_well_we_should": "Asking how \"well\" we should treat animals is the wrong question in the first place. Supposed \"happy\" animals are really treated no differently than those in factory farms.",
    "for_example_there_are_no": "For example, there are no special transport vehicles for \"humanely-raised\" animals. The process of transport is the same as conventional animals and is a miserable, often fatal experience. Animals are forced onto trucks with weapons, prods, and even forklifts. Inside, it doesn’t matter if the animals are terrified or in pain, as long as they get to the slaughterhouse alive.",

    "to_some_humane_legislation": "To some, \"humane\" legislation appears to get us closer to having better lives for animals. Animal welfare legislation calls for larger confinements and methods of slaughter which supposedly cause less pain. However, these reforms are industry practices which do away with economically wasteful and outdated practices.",
    "animal_welfare_fosters_more": "Animal welfare fosters more economically beneficial standards for producers and makes the public feel better about exploiting animals through marketing. It’s not about \"them,\" the producers, it’s about us. We are the consumers, we are the ones paying for this practice to happen. The first, most important thing we can do to address this violence is to go vegan.\n",
    "the_use_of_humane_slaughter": "[The use of humane slaughter methods]...results in safer and better working conditions…brings about the improvement of products and economies in slaughtering operations; and produces other benefits for producers, processors, and consumers which tend to expedite an orderly flow of livestock and livestock products...",

    "but_if_for_some_reason": "But if for some reason you’re thinking you may want to go vegetarian first, remember: vegetarianism means you’ll still be eating animal products and not necessarily less. You'll still be supporting the use of animals. All animal use involves unspeakable violence.",

    "me_ensminger": "M.E. Ensminger, PhD",
    "consuming_a_plant_based": "Consuming a plant-based diet also has significant benefits for our environment. For example, the amount of potatoes we can produce from an acre of land is about **40,000 lbs** compared to only **250 lbs** of cow flesh supported from the same acre. When we feed plants to animals in order to eat the animal, we waste an enormous amount of food. **For only one pound of cow flesh, 16 lbs of plant food and 5,000 gallons of water are required**.",
    "compare_that_to_25": "Compare that to 25 gallons of water for a pound of wheat. Animal agriculture is also responsible for most of the food-borne illness epidemics from water runoff.

    "some_of_our_newly": "Some of our newly vegan friends are worried they'll have trouble living in a small town where specialty soy products aren't available. To the contrary, eating a vegan version of a typical omnivore diet is one of the worst ways to kick off your first day as a vegan.",
    "not_that_theres_anything": "Not that there's anything wrong with having a vegan soy patty or soy grilled cheese, but it's neither healthy, affordable, or practical to sustain yourself on those types of foods. Instead, familiarize yourself with new kinds of ingredients like tofu and tempeh.",

    "no_veganism_is_not_expensive": "No! Veganism is not expensive. While there are plenty of nonvegans ready to tell you otherwise, this is largely due to the myth that vegans are eating processed soy versions of what everyone else eats. In fact, vegans survive mainly on beans, rice, pasta, fruits, and vegetables--the cheapest ingredients on earth.",

While we can draw lines between some intellectual differences of humans and other animals, all sentient beings have nerves and a brain.",

Whether it be a human, an ape, a cat, or a gerbil, no sentient being has “better” or more advanced nerves.  The animals we use for enjoyment and convenience have families, desires, and personalities. They taste food, enjoy the company of others, and value many of the qualities of life we as humans hold sacred in the experience of living. So while we may have some very different cognitive abilities, what we take from animals by reducing them to our “things” is as devastating to them as it is would be to us.",

    "54-are-animal-welfar": "Are 'animal welfare' supporters indistinguishable from the animal exploiters they oppose? Do reformist measures reaffirm the underlying principles that make animal exploitation possible in the first place? In this provocative book, Gary L. Francione argues that the modern animal rights movement has become indistinguishable from a century-old concern with the welfare of animals that in no way prevents them from being exploited. Francione maintains that advocating humane treatment of animals retains a sense of them as instrumental to human ends. When they are considered dispensable property, he says, they are left fundamentally without 'rights'. Until the seventies, Francione claims, this was the paradigm within which the Animal Rights Movement operated, as demonstrated by laws such as the Federal Humane Slaughter Act of 1958.",
    "98-in-this-wide-rang": "In this wide-ranging book, Francione takes the reader through the philosophical and intellectual debates surrounding animal welfare to make clear the difference between animal rights and animal welfare. Through case studies such as campaigns against animal shelters, animal laboratories, and the wearing of fur, Francione demonstrates the selectiveness and confusion inherent in reformist programs that target fur, for example, but leave wool and leather alone. The solution to this dilemma, Francione argues, is not in a liberal position that espouses the humane treatment of animals, but in a more radical acceptance of the fundamental inalienability of animal rights. Author note: Gary L. Francione is Professor of Law and Nicholas de B. Katzenbach Scholar of Law at Rutgers University Law School, Newark. He is the co-director of the \"Rutgers Animal Rights Law Center\" and the author of \"Animals, Property, and the Law\" (Temple).\"",
